Dataset: Diabetes
Description: 
The dataset I used for this project is about diabetes. The components of the dataset are 
Pregnancies, Ages, Blood Pressure, and Skin Thickness of the patients along with the testing of 
Glucose, Insulin, and BMI in their bodies. The final component of the dataset is the Outcome 
that tells if the patient has a diabetes or no. The outcome is based on 0 and 1, where 1 represents 
the diabetic patient and 0 represents the non-diabetic patient. 
Pipeline:
To implement the Machine Learning Classifier on a diabetic health-care dataset, I first, started 
with preprocessing/ exploratoring the dataset. I checked all the components of the dataset, and 
see the outcomes for the diabetic patients. I also checked for non-missing values, in case, if there 
are some and they effect the accuracy of the model predictions. Then, I split the data into training 
and testing sets. After that, I used 4 components to perform the Dimensionality Reduction on the 
diabetes model using PCA from the Sklearn.decomposition. I used the RandomForest and 
LinearSVR classifiers for the diabetes model, and get the accuracies, along with the AUC score 
and Confusion Matrix to find the False positives and False negatives from the dataset. I showed 
that visually using seaborn heatmap. At the end, I printed the classification report of the model 
for better understanding of the model.
Results:
Accuracies from Model Classifiers: In Diabetes Dataset, I performed two different types of 
Model Classifiers to find out the better accuracy for our model. First, I used Random Forest
Classifier (RF) to train and test our model for diabetes. The accuracy I have from RF is 
72.727273. Another classifier that I used for the model was Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
LinearSVC Classifier. The accuracy I received from the LinearSVC is 63.636363. Based on 
these accuracies results, I think RF Classifier works better for the Diabetes model than the SVC, 
because the accuracy contained using SVC is lower than the accuracy of the RF. 
AUC Score: Another prediction that we made on our model is based on AUC Scores. The AUC 
score, I receieved for the dataset based on our training and testing data sets is approximately 
0.769216. This score is not very bad, but it is not ideal for our model since the best AUC score is 
1.0. Therefore, our model will need some improvements in order to perform perfectly. 
Confusion Matrix: I also used the confusion matrix to train and test our model’s datasets in order 
to find the False Positive and Negative rates. I calculated the confusion matrix using formulas, and 
found out the results. The rate for False Positives is 0.23, and the rate for False Negatives is 0.58. 
Model in the Real World: 
Using patients’ records, we can build a Random Forest Machine Learning Model to accurately 
predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. We are using Random Forest 
because it was the best one of all the classifiers that we use in implementing the model. With the 
use of some application or devices such as glucose meter to monitor the sugar level from the body, 
will give the accurate glucose level that further will be helpful for the model to predict accurate 
result for diabetes disease. Basically, this model would be helpful in Diagnosing the Diabetic 
Disease in the real world. However, the pitfall of this model can be of predicting/generating False 
Negative or False Positive Rates as we have also seen during the implementation of the model.
